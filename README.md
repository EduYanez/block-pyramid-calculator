# block-pyramid-calculator
This simple python code uses while and if conditions to evaluate the height of a flat pyramid using a giving  amount of blocks.

(This excersise was extracted from Edube.org Python Essencials Part 2)

The purpose is simple: You build a **flat pyramid** with blocks. The only rule is that the lower level must have +1 than the upper level in any moment. If you do not comply with this condition, you must stop and count the height your pyramid reached!

A visual representation of the pyramid:

&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;     [_ ] **Height: 4**  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   [_ ][_ ]  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   [_ ][_ ][_ ]       
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   [_ ][_ ][_ ][_ ]  
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   **Used Blocks: 10**
